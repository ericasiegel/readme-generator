# README GENERATOR

## Description 

This is a back-end projected developed with node.js to create a professional readme file for professional webdevelopers. This application uses the command line in the user's Terminal to create a readme file by asking a variety of questions. These questions are prompted using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and created with [Inquirer Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The user is able to put in as much information as they would like, per prompted question, and then the application writes a README.md file and organizes the questions based off of the user's input.

This project was created with the goal of making the creation of a professional README.md file as easy as possible. The user already has a lot of work on their plate when it comes to creating a fully functioning application. This app takes the design and guessing out of the user's hands and creates a fully functioning, professional readme with just a few answers from the user.
